## Project Overview
In this project I have created a hotel bookings management system that links to a spreadsheet. The user operating the system can create a booking by entering inputs of the client for whom the booking is made. The system ensures correct data is entered within each input by raising an error if incorrect data or format is entered. The system also generates a total cost of stay at the hotel based on the type of room selected, the number of nights and number of guests. Finally the system than generates a booking ID for each client and adds it to the spreadsheet. The user can also fetch all bookings to be displayed altogether or display each booking by entering a specific booking ID.

## User Stories
* As a user I want to use booking management system
* As a user I want to create a customer booking
* As a user I want specific data requirements i.e name, contact no, checkin/checkout to be able to make a distinct booking
* As a user I want to assign a unique booking ID to for each booking
* As a user I want to be able to store bookings in a spreadsheet
* As a user I want to fetch all bookings from the spreadsheet or by booking ID

## Design 
* The project is a terminal based application that opens in web page, with a button to run the program at the top and a background image.

## Flow Chart
* The application follows the following diagram:
![](/assets/readme-files/Boutique-Hotel%20-flowchart.jpeg)

## Current Features
* The application runs the main menu home page which displays 3 options the user can choose from:
  1. **Enter/Manage Bookings**
  2. **Display Booking Data**
  3. **Exit**

* **Enter/Manage Bookings**, a booking sub menu opens displaying 3 options:
  1. **The Enter a booking**
  2. **Display booking**
  3. **Back to main menu**
* **Enter a booking**, the system prompts a series of sequential inputs, NAME, TELEPHONE NO., DATE OF BIRTH, CHECK-IN, CHECK-OUT, ROOM TYPE, and NO. OF GUESTS and saves the data in a spreadsheet.
* Each of these inputs is validated to only accept certain inputs i.e alphabets or digits and formatt.
* **Display booking** displays the booking just created with a unique booking ID and calculates and displays the total cost of the stay based on the number of nights from CHECK-IN, CHECK-OUT, ROOM TYPE, and NO. OF GUESTS.

* **Display Booking Data**, a display sub menu opens with 3 options:
  1. **Display all Booking Data**
  2. **Display Booking Data by BookingID**
  3. **Back to main menu**
* **Display all Booking Data**, display all bookings stored in the spreadsheet
* **Display Booking Data by BookingID**, promopts the user to enter an ID and displays only the booking with that ID.

### Future Features
* Add a feature to update booking and also to delete bookings

## Technology
  ### Languages 
  * [HTML:](https://www.w3.org/html/)  - HTML5 provided the skeleton for the project for the display
  * [CSS:](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) - CSS was used to style.CSS was used to manage the UI.
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Used for the main interaction with the user.

  ### Libraries
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git was used to managing the code. Allowing me to create backups whenever significant changes were made to code by utilizing the gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
  * [GitHub:](https://github.com/) - GitHub was used to externally store repository and site deployment.
  * [Os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html "Link to os homepage") -Os library was used to clear the previous print statement in the terminal. The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. Allowing me to perfome functionality between Windows and Mac operating systems.
  * [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html "Link to time homepage") - Time library was used to for check-in/check-out, no. of nights
  * [Random](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules/random "Link to random homepage")- Random library was used to get random booking ID
  * [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/# "Link to Am I Responsive Homepage")- Am I Responsive? was used to see if the site is responsive on different types of devices.
  * [Lucid](https://www.lucidchart.com/ "Link to Lucid") - To create the flow chart 
  * [platform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html "Link to platform")- Returns the system/OS name, such as 'Linux', 'Darwin', 'Java', 'Windows'.
  * [Gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/ "Link to gspread")-  gspread is a Python API for Google Sheets. Features: Google Sheets API v4. Open a spreadsheet by title, key or url. Read, write, and format cell ranges.
  * [Credentials](https://www.manageengine.com/products/asset-explorer/help/scanning_it_assets/credential_library.html "Link to creds")-  A credential file is nothing but just a configuration file with a tad bit of encryption and an unseen security structure in the backend. 
  * [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) - A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it;

## Testing
### test cases
* Through out the project I have carried out regular testing using print statments
* A booking system that creates,stores and display bookings
  ![test](./assets/readme-files/test1.png)
* Navigate throught the menu and sub menu

  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-sub-menu.png)
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-sub-menu2.png)
* Display room price based on type of room
* User is prompted to enter specific data to generate booking 
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-enter-specific-data.png)
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-store-data.png)
* The system runs an error if the type or format is incorrect
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-error1.png)
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-error2.png)
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-error3.png)
* Displays the unique booking ID and calculates total cost of stay
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-ID-total-cost.png)
* Display all bookings stored within the spread sheet
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-display-all.png.png)
* Display specific booking by booking ID
  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/test-display-by-ID.png)

### Fixed bugs
* Broken while loop, when inaccurate booking ID entered, displays error of "Customer doesn't exist with that ID " but does not prompt for ID again.

  ![Booking](./assets/readme-files/bug.png)
  
* To resolve the bug I removed the while loop and recalled the functions within its self at the end of the code block with in the **else** of an **if/else** statement.

* Line to long error
  ![line](./assets/readme-files/error-line-to-long.png)
  * To resolve this error I used the black formatter
  - In the terminal enter "Pip3 install black"
  - Then enter "$ black -l 79 --preview run.py"

* Comparison False 
  ![comparison](./assets/readme-files/error-comparison.png)
  ![comparison](./assets/readme-files/error-comparison-code.png)
  - To resolve this error I use "is"
